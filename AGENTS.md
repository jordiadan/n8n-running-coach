# Instructions for AI / Codex

Follow the workflow rules in `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md` strictly:
- use only Jira workspace `Running Coach` (`RC` project, board `34`): `https://jordiadan.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RC/boards/34/backlog`
- one ticket = one branch
- one task = one PR
- branch naming: `RC-<id>-<kebab-title>`
- PR must use the PR template
- no direct pushes to `main`/`master`
- Jira status updates are mandatory (`To do` -> `In progress` -> `In review` -> `Done`)
- every active issue must be in the current sprint and linked to the correct epic

If rules conflict with repository docs, `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md` is the source of truth.
